1) To understand and model the static structure of a software system in StarUML/Diagram Editor 

---– Model a Library Management System (LMS) that manages books, members, and library staff. ----
The system should include functionalities like issuing books, returning books, and maintaining member and book records.----


-Tasks: 
i) Class Diagram Creation (Using StarUML/Diagram Editor): 
Design a class diagram for the LMS with the following classes: 
• Book 
• Member 
• Librarian 
• Library 
• Transaction 

-Include: 
• Attributes and methods for each class. 
• Relationships: inheritance, association, aggregation/composition, and multiplicity. 

e.g. 
• Library has a collection of Books. 
• Member borrows Books through Transactions. 
• Librarian manages Transactions. 

ii) Object Diagram Creation (Using StarUML/Diagram Editor): 
Create an object diagram based on the above class diagram for the following scenario: 
"Member A borrows the book Design Patterns on 25 July 2025. The librarian B handles the 
transaction." 
Represent the instantiated objects: 
• book1: Book 
• member1: Member 
• librarian1: Librarian 
• txn1: Transaction 

[To Show how they are connected based on associations in the class diagram.]
